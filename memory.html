        <h1>Our First Date ❤️</h1>
        <p class="memory-text" >Our first date will always be special, but for me, 
            every time we meet feels like the first date all over again.
             You know, I never get bored when I'm with you—even if we're silent or doing nothing at all,
              it's still perfect. Just being with you soothes me, and that in itself feels like enough.
               I feel special every time we’re together. When you cook for me, you truly cook so well—by the way!
                It’s the little gestures you do that make me feel so cherished. You’re like a goddess to me,
                 my lucky charm, someone who brings so much joy into my life. 
                 A thousand things have happened with me, but my heart 
                 has never been wrong when it comes to you. 
                 You’ve always remained at the same value in my heart.</p>
